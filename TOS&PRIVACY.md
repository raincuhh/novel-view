- **App Usage Data:** Information on how the user interacts with the app (e.g., which books are opened, when they were accessed, etc.), stored in a database.
- **Imported Ebooks:** Users will import their own eBooks, which will be converted to a specific JSON format for easier storage and faster loading. These eBooks are stored locally in your app.
- **Recent Book Tracking:** We track recently opened books for user experience improvements (e.g., recent books list, progress tracking).

**3. How We Use Your Data**

- **Account Management:** Email and username are used for creating and managing your account.
- **App Usage:** Usage data is used to improve user experience, like tracking which books are being read most frequently, recent reading history, etc.
- **Imported Ebooks:** We store and process the books you import locally but never share or sell that data.
- **Analytics:** The data we gather helps us improve the app and its features. This is generally anonymized data for internal use.

**4. Sharing Your Data**

- We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data.
- Data may be shared with third-party services (e.g., analytics platforms like Google Analytics or Firebase) to track app usage and performance.

- **Correction:** You can update or correct your personal data, such as your email, username, or password.
- **Deletion:** You can request that we delete your account and all associated data. This will result in the loss of your reading history and imported books.

**7. Security**

- We take data security seriously and use industry-standard measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic transmission is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
